## Description

This app is an IOS app that allows users to specify travel locations around the world and create virtual photo albums for each location, the photos are pulled from Flickr API based on the pin's location. The locations and photo albums will be saved in Core Data. Each image in the photos album can be edited by adding captions to it (top and bottom) and replaced with the old image.

## Instructions

First you have an empty map, to add a pin to a location you can just hold press a specific location and the pin will get dropped. When you click any pin the view wil change to a Photos Album View that displays 15 pictures from that location, you can delete or share any photo by clicking on it, also you can modify any image by adding captions to it to create a meme. To do that just click on any photo an alert will pop up then click on "Create Meme" this will take the image to another view where you can edit, share and save the image. After saving the image the view will go back to the Photos Album View and the old image will be replaced with the new edited image, also it will be saved in the Core Data.
